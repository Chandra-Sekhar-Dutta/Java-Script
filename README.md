## Asynchronous Function

This file demonstrates how to create and use asynchronous functions in JavaScript. Asynchronous functions allow for non-blocking code execution, which is useful for tasks such as fetching data from a server or performing time-consuming operations.

## Await Function

The `Await Function` file shows how to use the `await` keyword in JavaScript. It allows you to wait for a promise to resolve or reject, making asynchronous code easier to write and understand.

## Basic Input Taking

In this file, you'll find examples of how to take input from the user in JavaScript. It covers both prompt-based input in the browser and input handling in Node.js.

## Basic JavaScript

This file contains examples of basic JavaScript syntax and operations. It's a great starting point for beginners who want to learn how to declare variables, perform operations, and write simple functions.

## Callback Function

This file introduces the concept of callback functions in JavaScript. A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, allowing you to execute code after an asynchronous operation has completed.

## Class

The `Class` file demonstrates how to create and use classes in JavaScript. Classes are a blueprint for creating objects, providing a way to define object properties and methods.

## Filter

In this file, you will see how to use the `filter` method to create a new array containing only the elements that meet certain criteria.

## For Each Function

This file explains the `forEach` function, which is used to execute a provided function once for each array element. It’s a useful method for iterating over arrays in JavaScript.

## Hospital

The `Hospital` file demonstrates how to build a simple API using Express.js to manage a user's kidney health records. The API supports CRUD operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting kidney health status. The code shows how to handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

## HTTP

This file contains a simple Express.js application that demonstrates how to handle HTTP GET requests. The route returns a JSON response with a user's name and age.

## HTTP2

The `HTTP2` file expands on handling HTTP requests with Express.js. It includes both GET and POST requests, showing how to read headers and respond with HTML or text data.

## HTTP3

In `HTTP3`, you'll find a demonstration of how to use query parameters in Express.js to add two numbers. It includes error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring that only valid numbers are processed.

## JSON

The `JSON` file explains how to work with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in JavaScript. It covers parsing JSON strings into objects and converting objects to JSON strings.

## Map

This file shows how to use the `map` function in JavaScript. The `map` function creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

## Objects

The `Objects` file demonstrates how to create and manipulate objects in JavaScript. It covers object properties, methods, and how to access and modify them.

## Promise Function

In this file, you'll find examples of how to create and use promises in JavaScript. Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations, providing methods to deal with success (`then`) and failure (`catch`).

## Read File

The `Read File` file shows how to read the contents of a file using JavaScript, specifically in Node.js. It covers both synchronous and asynchronous file reading.

## ReWrite Function

This file demonstrates how to rewrite the contents of a file using JavaScript in Node.js. It’s useful for cases where you need to update or completely replace the content of an existing file.

## String

The `String` file contains examples of string manipulation in JavaScript. It covers common operations like concatenation, slicing, and searching within strings.

## Terminal Clock

This file contains the code for a terminal-based clock application written in JavaScript. It updates the current time every second and displays it in the terminal.

## To Number

In this file, you'll find examples of converting different data types to numbers in JavaScript. It includes the use of functions like `parseInt`, `parseFloat`, and the unary `+` operator.
